PyroCMS Redirect Plugin
=======================

A very simple plugin to redirect a user to another URL. Couldn't find an y tags to do it! Sorry if one exists. 

It's useful if you are doing extra processing or conditional checks and want to redirect a user elsewhere. For example, setting a session variable with  may require a redirect for the variable to be registered.

Usage
-----
{{ redirect:url url="/my-url" }}
